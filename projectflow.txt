Building out pipeline:
1> We are creating github repo and cloning it in our local for exxperiments
2> Add src folder,along with all components and running them individually
3> Add data, model, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add ,commit,push 

Setting up dvc pipeline(without params)
5>Create dvc.yml file and stages to it.
6>dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check "dvc dag" --> this will help to visualize the flow )
# dag is called as ->> Directed Acyclic Graph
7>Now git add commit push
